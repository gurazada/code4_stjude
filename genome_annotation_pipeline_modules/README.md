Python modules written by Guna Gurazada, that are part of a large 11-12 step genome annnotation pipeline written using workflow management tool (fireworks, similar to NextFlow) and deployed to on-prem high-performance compute cluster.

The modules are wrappers around specific bioinformatics tools, but perform error handling, input formatting, cluster parallelization, and output file specifications/reformatting where necessary, so the results conform to expected input of next sequential step.
